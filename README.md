# diego’s computer science notes

here you can find the notes from my bachelor's degree in computer science @Sapienza University\

[!warning] vim motions
when you open the vault you will be dropped in the editor with vim motions! if you don't use vim motions, go to Settings->Editor->Vim Key bindings and turn them off
