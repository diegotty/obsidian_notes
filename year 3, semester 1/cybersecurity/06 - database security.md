# database security
database security has not kept pace with the increased reliance on databases for a number of reasons:
- DBMS are much more complex than the security techniques used to protect them. their interation protocol (SQL) is complex, and effective DB security requires a strategy based on a full understanding of the security vulnerabilities of SQL.
- most enterprise environments consist of a heterogeneous mixture of database, enterprise and OS platforms, creating an additional complexity hurdle for security personnel.
- the intreasing reliance on cloud technology to host part of all of the corporate database
