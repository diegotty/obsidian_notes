“a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim”
## classification of malware
malware is classified broadly into two categories, based on two main factors:
- *how it spreads* to reach the desired targets.
- *the actions or payloads it performs* once a target is reached
*propagation mechanisms* include:
- *infection* of existing content by viruses, that is subsequently spread to other systems
- *exploit* of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- *social engineering* attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
payload *actions performed* by malware once it reaches its target system can include:
- *corruption* of system or data files
- *theft of service*/make the systems a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- *theft of information* from the system / keylogging
- *hididing its presence* on the system

it is also classified by its independency and replication ability

| *independent*     | self-contained programs that can *run on their own*                      | worms, trojans, bots |
| *non-replicating* | malware that *does not create copies* of itself or spread automatically. | trojans, spam e-mail |
| *replicating*     | malware that *self-replicates* and spreads to other systems.             | viruses, worms       |
## attack kits
initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skills by the authors, however the *toolkits* (also known as *crimeware*) created in the 1990s and 2000s greatly assisted in the development of malware
- they include a variety of pro
