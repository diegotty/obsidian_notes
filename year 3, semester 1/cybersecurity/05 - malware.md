“a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim”
## classification of malware
malware is classified broadly into two categories, based on two main factors:
- *how it spreads* to reach the desired targets.
- *the actions or payloads it performs* once a target is reached
*propagation mechanisms* include:
- *infection* of existing content by viruses, that is subsequently spread to other systems
- *exploit* of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- *social engineering* attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
payload *actions performed* by malware once it reaches its target system can include:
- *corruption* of system or data files
- *theft of service*/make the systems a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- *theft of information* from the system / keylogging
- *hididing its presence* on the system

it is also classified by its independency and replication ability

| classified as     | description                                                              | example              |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| *needs a host*    | parasitic code that *requires another legitimate program* to attach to   | viruses              |
| *independent*     | self-contained programs that can *run on their own*                      | worms, trojans, bots |
| *non-replicating* | malware that *does not create copies* of itself or spread automatically. | trojans, spam e-mail |
| *replicating*     | malware that *self-replicates* and spreads to other systems.             | viruses, worms       |
## attacks
initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skills by the authors, however the *toolkits* (also known as *crimeware*) created in the 1990s and 2000s greatly assisted in the development of malware
- they include a variety of propagation mechanisms, and variants that can be generated by attackers using these toolkits create a significant problem for those defending systems against them
another change is the nature of the attackers: from being individuals motivated to demonstrate their technical competence to their peers, to more organized and dangerous attack sources such as politically motivated hackerse, criminals or organizations that sell their services to companies and nations.
- huge underground economy for the sale of attack kits. great niche !
## APT
*advanced persistent threats* (*APT*) are well-resourced, persistent (over a long period of time) applications that differ from other types of attacks by their careful target selections (usually business or political) and stealthy intrusion efforts over extended periods
- *advanced*: APTs span a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, including the development of custom malware. while the individual components may not necessarily be technically advanced, they are chosen carefully to suit the selected target
- *persistent*: attacks happen over an exetended period of time, in order to maximize the chance of success against the target
- *threats*:
