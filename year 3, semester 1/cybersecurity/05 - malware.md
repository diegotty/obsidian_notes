“a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim”
## classification of malware
malware is classified broadly into two categories, based on two main factors:
- *how it spreads* to reach the desired targets.
- *the actions or payloads it performs* once a target is reached
*propagation mechanisms* include:
- *infection* of existing content by viruses, that is subsequently spread to other systems
- *exploit* of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- *social engineering* attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
payload *actions performed* by malware once it reaches its target system can include:
- *corruption* of system or data files
- *theft of service*/make the systems a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- *theft of information* from the system / keylogging
- *hididing its presence* on the system

it is also classified by its independency and replication ability

| classified as     | description                                                              | example              |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| *needs a host*    | parasitic code that *requires another legitimate program* to attach to   | viruses              |
| *independent*     | self-contained programs that can *run on their own*                      | worms, trojans, bots |
| *non-replicating* | malware that *does not create copies* of itself or spread automatically. | trojans, spam e-mail |
| *replicating*     | malware that *self-replicates* and spreads to other systems.             | viruses, worms       |
## attacks
initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skills by the authors, however the *toolkits* (also known as *crimeware*) created in the 1990s and 2000s greatly assisted in the development of malware
- they include a variety of propagation mechanisms, and variants that can be generated by attackers using these toolkits create a significant problem for those defending systems against them
another change is the nature of the attackers: from being individuals motivated to demonstrate their technical competence to their peers, to more organized and dangerous attack sources such as politically motivated hackerse, criminals or organizations that sell their services to companies and nations.
- huge underground economy for the sale of attack kits. great niche !
## APT
*advanced persistent threats* (*APT*) are well-resourced, persistent (over a long period of time) applications that differ from other types of attacks by their careful target selections (usually business or political) and stealthy intrusion efforts over extended periods
- *advanced*: APTs span a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, including the development of custom malware. while the individual components may not necessarily be technically advanced, they are chosen carefully to suit the selected target
- *persistent*: attacks happen over an exetended period of time, in order to maximize the chance of success against the target
- *threats*: they are threats to the selected targets because of the high commitment by organized, capable attrackers (so active attack, no automated attack tools)
the aim can be different, from theft of intellectual property to the physical disruption of an infrastructure
- once they have gained access to systems in the target organization, a further range of attack tools are used to maintain and extend their access
## viruses
a *virus* is a piece of software that infects programs.
- it modifies them to include a copy of the virus
- replicates and goes on to infect other programs or into
- easily spreads through network environments
a virus is dangerous because when attached to an executable program, it can do anything that the program is permitted to do.
it is comprised by:
- an *infection mechanism*: means by which a virus spreads or propagates
- a *trigger*(/*logic bomb*): an event that determines when the payload is activated/delivered
- a *payload*: what the virus does (besides spreading)
### virus phases

| *triggering phase**  | virus is *activated* to perform the function for which it was intended                       | can be caused by a variety of system events              | -                                                                                                       |
| *propagation phase** | virus places a *copy* of itself into other programs or into certain system areas on the disk | the copy may not be identical to the propagating version | each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus which will itself enter a propagation phase |
| *execution phase**   | *function* is performed                                                                      | may be harmless or damaging                              | -                                                                                                       |

>[!def] macro virus
“a virus that attaches itself to documents and uses the macro programming capabilities of the document’s application to execute and propagate”

macro viruses infect scripting code used to *support active content* in a variety of user document types !
they are threatening because:
- they are much easier to write or to modify than traditional executable viruses
- they are independent
- they infect documents and not code, and traditional file systems access controls are of limited use in preventing their spread
- they spread easily
>[!example] melissa macro virus pseudo-code
>```
>macro Document_Open 
>	disable Macro menu and some macro security features
>	if called from a user document
>		copy macro code into Normal template file 
>	else
>		copy macro code into user document being opened
>	end if 
>	if registry key "Melissa" not present
>		if Outlook is email client 
>			for first 50 addresses in address book
>				send email to that address with currently infected document attached
>			end for
>		end if
>		create registry key "Melissa"
>	end if
>	if minute in hour equals day of month
>		insert text into document being opened
>	end if
>end macro

### virus classification
virus can be classified by target:
- *boot sector infector*: infects a [[filesystem in UNIX, Windows, Linux#regioni del volume|master boot record]] or boot record, and spreads when a system is booted from the disk
- *file infector*: infects files that the operating system or shell considers to be exectuable
- *macro virus*: infects files with macro or scripting code that gets interpreted by an application
- *multipartite virus*: infects files in multiple ways
they can also be classified by concealment strategy:
- *encrypted virus*: a portion of the virus creates a random encryption key and encrypts the remainder of the virus
- *stealth virus*: a form of virus explicitly designed to hide itself from detection by anti-virus software
- *polymorphic virus*: a virus that mutates with every infection (basically, are like encrypted virus but change the small decryption routine everytime, leaving the main code body constant)
- *metamorphic virus*: a virus that mutates and rewrites itself completely at each interaction and may change behaviour as well as appearance
	- the pinnacle of malware evolution, they contain a “mutation engine” that performs comprehensive (assembly)code transformations , like instruction substitution (with equivalent code), garbage code insertion, and independent code permutation
## worms
*worms* are programs that actively seek out more machines to infect. each infected machine serves as an automated launching pad for attacks on other machines
- they exploit software vulnerabilities in client or server programs
- spread through shared media or email, using macro or script code included in attachments
- unpon activation, the worm may replicate and propagate again
- usualy carries some form of payload
### replication
worms can replicate in many ways:
- *email or instant messenger facility*: the worm sends a copy of itself to other systems through email, or as an attachment via a message service
- *file sharing*: creates a copy of itself or infects a file as a virus on removable media
- *remote execution capability*: worm executes a copy of itself on another system
- *remote file access or transfer capability*: worm uses a remote file access or transfer device to copy itself from one system to the other
- *remote login capability*: worm logs onto a remote system as a user and then uses commands to copy itself from one system to the other
### target discovery
targets are discovered through:
- *scanning/fingerprinting*: the worm searches for other systems to infect
- *random*: compromised hosts probe random addresses in the IP space, using a different seed. this produces a high volume of internet traffic which may cause generalized disruption even before the actual attack is launched
- *hit-list*: the attacker comples a list of potential vulnerable machines, and each infected machine is provided with a portion of the list to scan for.
- *topological*: information contained on an infected victim machine is used to find more hosts to scan
- *local subnet*: the host uses subnet address structure to find other hosts (in the same LAN) that would otherwise be protected behind a firewall (instead, traffic moving inside a local network is much less scrutinized by perimeter firewalls)
